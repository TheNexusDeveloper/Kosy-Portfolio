                   I have always been heavily invested in tech from a very young age. QBASIC was the first programming language I ever encountered in Junior High School.
                   This was followed by Java and then HTML and CSS in my final years of High school. 
                   I Started coding in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown. During this period, I learnt Python and JavaScript. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am skilled in frontend development using ReactJs and Redux for state management, Django and RESTful API for backend 
                    and FIGMA for UI/UX Design.
                    In addition to coding, I'm also skilled and knowledgeable in DevOps principles and tools, Network Automation and Operations, Network Architectural Design and Network Troubleshooting.
