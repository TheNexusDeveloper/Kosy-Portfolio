                I am a passionate and versatile Solutions Architect with deep expertise in ISP core networks, network design, and service delivery. 
                I specialize in building and optimizing high-performance network infrastructure that powers reliable internet and cloud services. 
                From core routing to customer-edge deployments, my focus is on designing scalable, secure, 
                and customer-centric solutions that meet real-world business needs.

                With a strong foundation in Linux, IT, network support, and cloud environments, I bridge the gap between infrastructure and innovation. 
                I also develop modern web applications using a tech stack which consists of React, FastApi and Djangoâ€”bringing full-stack capability to my problem-solving toolkit.

                    Beyond my professional life, outside the world of networks and code, 
                    I'm passionate about music, great food, and fictional superheroesâ€”because every architect needs a little imagination.
